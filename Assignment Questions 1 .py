# # ðŸ’¡ **Q1.** Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
# 
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# 
# You can return the answer in any order.
# 
# **Example:**
# Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output0 [0,1]
# 
# **Explanation:** Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1]

# ðŸ’¡ **Q2.** Given an integer array nums and an integer val, remove all occurrences of val in nums in-place. The order of the elements may be changed. Then return the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val.
# 
# Consider the number of elements in nums which are not equal to val be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
# 
# - Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the elements which are not equal to val. The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
# - Return k.
# 
# **Example :**
# Input: nums = [3,2,2,3], val = 3
# Output: 2, nums = [2,2,_*,_*]
# 
# **Explanation:** Your function should return k = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 2. It does not matter what you leave beyond the returned k (hence they are underscores)[

# Increment the large integer by one and return the resulting array of digits.

# **Example 1:**

# ðŸ’¡ **Q5.** You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

# Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
# 
# The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
