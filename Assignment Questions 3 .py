# # Question 1
# Given an integer array nums of length n and an integer target, find three integers
# in nums such that the sum is closest to the target.
# Return the sum of the three integers.
# 
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.
# 
# Example 1:
# Input: nums = [-1,2,1,-4], target = 1
# Output: 2
# 
# Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).

# üí° **Question 3**
# A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a
# sequence or linear order.
# 
# For example, for arr = [1,2,3], the following are all the permutations of arr:
# [1,2,3], [1,3,2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3,1,2], [3,2,1].
# 
# The next permutation of an array of integers is the next lexicographically greater
# permutation of its integer. More formally, if all the permutations of the array are
# sorted in one container according to their lexicographical order, then the next
# permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted container.
# 
# If such an arrangement is not possible, the array must be rearranged as the
# lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).
# 
# ‚óè For example, the next permutation of arr = [1,2,3] is [1,3,2].
# ‚óè Similarly, the next permutation of arr = [2,3,1] is [3,1,2].
# ‚óè While the next permutation of arr = [3,2,1] is [1,2,3] because [3,2,1] does not
# have a lexicographical larger rearrangement.
# 
# Given an array of integers nums, find the next permutation of nums.
# The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.
# 
# **Example 1:**
# Input: nums = [1,2,3]
# Output: [1,3,2]
